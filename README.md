# Stocks
This program is implemented using the Queues and Linked Lists algorithms in the Java programming language
Share of common stock of some company is sold, the capital gain or may be loss is the difference between the shareâ€™s selling price and the price originally paid to buy it. 
This rule is easy to understand for a single share, but if sell multiple shares of stock bought over a long period of time, then must identify the shares actually being sold.
